The use of an inductor prevents the current from building up or dying down too quickly. If the inductor 
is made large enough, the current becomes continuous and nearly constant. The inductor prevents the current 
from ever reaching the peak value which would otherwise be reached without a filter inductor. Consequently, 
the output voltage never reaches the peak value of the applied sine wave. Thus, a rectifier whose output is 
filtered by an inductor cannot produce as high a voltage as that could be produced by a rectifier filtered by a 
capacitor. However, this disadvantage is partly compensated because the inductor filter permits a larger current 
without a serious change in output voltage. This is the reason that an inductor filter is suitable for high power 
applications
